w3m: WWW wo Miru Tool
=====================

w3m is a pager with WWW capability.  It IS a pager, but it can be used
as a text-mode WWW browser.

This package is maintained for Debian <https://www.debian.org>,
forked from the original version <https://sourceforge.net/projects/w3m/>.

w3m-vimium (this fork)
======================

This repository is a small fork that adds a Vimium/Qutebrowser-style workflow
on top of w3m.

Added features
--------------

- Link hint mode:
  - `f` hint visible links and follow
  - `F` hint visible links and open in a new tab
- Yank/copy:
  - `yy` copy current page URL to clipboard
  - `yf` hint visible links and copy the selected link URL to clipboard
- Vimium-like navigation remaps (default keymap):
  - `j` scroll down, `k` scroll up
  - `h` scroll left, `l` scroll right
  - `H` back, `L` forward
  - `gg` go to top (implemented as a `g` prefix)

Clipboard integration
---------------------

Clipboard writing uses the first available tool:

- `wl-copy` (Wayland)
- `xclip` (X11)
- `xsel` (X11)

You can override the command via `W3M_CLIPBOARD_CMD` (reads text from stdin),
for example:

    export W3M_CLIPBOARD_CMD="wl-copy"

If no clipboard tool is available, yank commands will show a message.

Build / install notes
---------------------

w3m requires Boehm GC headers (`gc.h`). You can either install your distro's GC
development package, or build/install Boehm GC yourself and point w3m to it.

On Fedora, you may need to explicitly select terminfo at configure time:

    --with-termlib=:libtinfo.so.6

Upstream / remotes
------------------

- `origin` points to this fork.
- `upstream` points to the upstream w3m repository.
